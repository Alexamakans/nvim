# TODO

- [x] Make creating/installing a new profile easier.
- [x] Declarative install of tree sitter parsers.
- [] Maybe flesh out base profile with common TS parsers/lsps/linters/formatters:
  - [] yaml
  - [] json
  - [] toml
  - [] markdown
  - [] dockerfile
  - [] docker compose?
- [] Automatically uninstall mason/treesitters that are no longer declared for
     installation.
- [] Install packer modules from profile.
